## Description
SingIt is a cross-platform mobile app in which a singer can record a performance (or album) via her/his device, and then publish, allowing for access to it at any place and any time. On the other hand, a listener, after enjoying the performances disseminated by the system, gives ratings (on a scale of 1-5) to the performances. We suggest songs that can get high performances to the user based on the genre in which the user has high ratings.

## Demo
Login screen will ask the user for credentials. Upon login, the user will be presented with options for settings, listen to all songs or to sing a new song.

<br>

On opting to sing a new song, the user will be asked to enter the name of the song and the genre to which it belongs. On clicking Record, the app will start recording the user's performance.

<br>

Upon clicking the option view all songs, the user will be taken to 'All Songs' page which will present all performances filtered by song and user. The user will also be able to rate individual performances here.

Upon clicking the option for getting a song recommendation, the app will present a recommended song generated by internal algorithm to get high performance based on the genre in which the user has high ratings.
