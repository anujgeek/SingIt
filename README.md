## Description
SingIt! is a cross-platform mobile app in which a singer can record a performance (or album) via her/his device, and then publish, allowing for access to it at any place and any time. On the other hand, a listener, after enjoying the performances disseminated by the system, gives ratings (on a scale of 1-5) to the performances. We suggest songs that can get high performances to the user based on the genre in which the user has high ratings.
